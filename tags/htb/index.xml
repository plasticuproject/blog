      <description>Safe is an easy difficulty Linux machine. In this write-up we will complete the binary exploitation section of the lab. We will examine a networked CLI application, find a buffer overflow vulnerability, then design and execute a return-oriented programming exploit to gain shell access to the server.</description>

      <description>Console is a medium difficulty web challenge where we will install a php-console browser extension, review the related source code and use what we learn to perform an offline dictionary attack on a salted hash to obtain authentication for server-side control.</description>

      <description>Obscurity is a medium difficulty box where we will leverage bad server code to inject and run commands, and take advantage of poor cryptography and leftover files to get user access. From there we take advantage of sudo privileges and a poorly executed program to read the root.txt file.</description>

      <description>Mango is a medium difficulty box where with basic enumeration and some MongoDB NO-SQL Injection we can extract user passwords to log in and get user access. From there we will leverage a classic jjs privilege escalation to get root access and read the root.txt file.</description>
